    local api = _G.WindChatFilter.API

    -- filter should have the following structure:
    --   - priority: number
    --   - func: function to handle `chatData`

    -- chatData should have the following structure:
    --   - channel: string
    --   - message: string
    --   - sender: string
    --   - guid: string

    -- add a filter that if the message is "test", it will be filtered
    api.RegisterBlackList("testFilter", {
        priority = 1,
        func = function(data)
            if data.message == "test" then
                return true
            end
            return false
        end
    })

    -- first test
    api.TestWithAllFilters({
        channel = "Say",
        message = "test",
        sender = "testSender",
        guid = "testGUID"
    })

    -- second test
    api.TestWithAllFilters({
        channel = "Guild",
        message = "Nothing",
        sender = "testSender",
        guid = "testGUID"
    })

    -- remove the filter
    api.UnregisterBlackList("testFilter")

    -- rebuild the cache
    api.RebuildRules()
    ```
